# Rotting Hill

A 2D shoot 'em up game developed in Objective-C using X-Code and sprite kit. 

- The player uses virtual joysticks (left to move, right to shoot) in the neverending battle against zombies.
- The longer the player lives, the faster and more ferocious the zombies become.
- Apples can be harvested from apple trees to replenish health.
- Shooting causes recoil, which pushes the player in the opposite direction.
   - Moving toward the direction you are shooting will slow you down.
   - Moving away from the direction you are shooting will speed you up.
